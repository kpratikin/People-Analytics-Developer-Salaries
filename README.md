  <b>Conclusion:</b> There are two ways in order to get higher salary
  <ol><li> Higher education i.e. do Master's and PHD's
  <li> Gain more experience
   </ol>
<br>   
However, it depends on individual developer situation. Following are the suggestions:<br>
<ul><li>For freshers, if you do master's you can earn slightly higher than your colleagues at the start of your career. However, in long run your experience determines your salaries.
<li>For working professional with more than 9 years of experience, there is no advantage in terms of salaries. So, for these people doing master's is not desirable in orde to increase their salary.
